# Text Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

# Project Description
This is a Machine Learning based Text Sentiment Analysis project.
The objective of this project is to analyze text data such as reviews or sentences
and determine the sentiment expressed in the text.

This project is NOT based on Deep Learning and does not use neural networks.
It uses traditional Machine Learning algorithms.

 #Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

# What the Project Does
- Takes text input (reviews / sentences)
- Cleans and preprocesses the text
- Converts text into numerical format using vectorization
- Trains multiple Machine Learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Selects the best performing model
- Evaluates model accuracy
- Saves the trained model
- Deploys the model as a web application using Streamlit

# Output
The model predicts sentiment as:
- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

# Use Cases
- Product review analysis
- Customer feedback analysis
- Social media sentiment analysis

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP techniques
can be used to understand and classify human sentiments from text data.
